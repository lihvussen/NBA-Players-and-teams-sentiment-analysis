# NBA-Players-and-teams-sentiment-analysis

This project aims at checking the sentiment towards NBA teams and the most popular players.
The used data for this purpose are almost 5000 comments from 50 Youtube vidoes from the official NBA channel.
Then, sentiment analysis of each comment is performed and tags are used in order to check which player or team the comment is addressed at.
Finally, for each player and team, an average of each metric is calculated and the obtained data is visualized.
